Hi, I’m Seijin Cha.
I’m a designer with experiences in industrial and interaction design. I’ve been fascinated for developing new experience concept utilizing new technology and materials.

I majored in industrial design and participated in projects for internationally renowned clients such as LG, Samsung, Volkswagen, etc., including nearly 2 years of practical field experiences in product design. 
During my master’s degree, I further studied on experience design surrounding interactive product and system. As a researcher of an interaction design lab, I implemented projects based on user research, involving users in design and evaluation process. Also I have experiences in creating (interactive) products through fabrication methods and physical computing skills such as Arduino and Processing.
Currently I am working as a designer at Naver Labs, South Korea.

I’m highly adaptable to diverse cultures and fields. Love travel, small talk, sports, sunrise.
